# Overview of Static Comp 1

I structured my HTML by creating a main container that holds the box container (the header the and the articles) and the photo container (aside).
I gave the box container a width of 60% and the photo container a width of 40%. All containers had a vh of 100.
Inside the box container, I gave the header a width of 66.66666% and a height of 33.33333vh. I gave each of the articles a width of 33.33333% and a height of 33.33333vh.
As I began to make the site responsive, I removed the large aside at 1024px, made the photo the background image of the profile article, removed the profile icon display, and created a profile button in the header.
This removed the widow article.
At 765px, I removed the photo completely and gave the header a width of 100% and the articles a width of 50%, allowing 2 articles per row.
When I sized down to 325px, I increased the article width to 100%, allowing only 1 article per row.
